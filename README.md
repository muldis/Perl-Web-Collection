# NAME

Perl5-Web-Collection

# DESCRIPTION

This is a historical archive of web-related Perl 5 modules developed
between 1998 and 2004, and published to CPAN between 2000 and 2005.

The archive exists mainly for informational purposes.

The Perl 5 modules here are essentially complete and functional for their
intended use cases, and you can use them, but they are no longer being
maintained with new feature enhancements or bug fixes.

People writing new Perl 5 web applications today should prefer using other,
more modern and state of the art frameworks, of which there are several.

The modules are organized in this archive into subfolders matching their
original CPAN distribution names, which evolved over time.  The history of
version control commits typically correspond to their public releases with
the same datestamps, and the latest commit reflects their last releases.
